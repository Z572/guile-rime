#+TITLE: Hacking guile-rime

* Contributing

By far the easiest way to hack on guile-rime is to develop using Guix:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Obtain the source code
  cd /path/to/source-code
  guix shell
  # In the new shell, run:
  ./bootstrap && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC

You can now hack this project's files to your heart's content, whilst
testing them from your `guix shell' shell.

To try out any scripts in the project you can now use

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./pre-inst-env scripts/${script-name}
#+END_SRC

** Manual Installation

If you do not yet use  Guix, you will have to install this project's
dependencies manually:
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - pkg-config
  - texinfo

  - guile
  - librime
  - guile-bytestructures
  optional:
  - rime-data :: Schema data

Once those dependencies are installed you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./bootstrap && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC
